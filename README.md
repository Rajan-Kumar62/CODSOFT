Task-1 :In this project, I built an interactive Number Guessing Game using Java.
The program randomly generates a number within a given range (1â€“100), and the user tries to guess it.
After each attempt, the program gives feedback â€” whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Features Included:

Random number generation

Limited number of attempts

Option for multiple rounds

Score calculation based on performance

User-friendly console interface


 Tech Used: Java (Core Concepts â€“ Loops, Conditionals, Random, Scanner)

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of control statements, loops, and user input handling in Java.

Task-2: In this task, I developed a Student Grade Calculator using Java.
The program allows users to:
   Input marks for multiple subjects
  Calculate total marks and average percentage
  Assign grades based on performance
  Display results clearly and efficiently

ðŸ“˜ Concepts Used:

Loops and conditional statements

User input handling (Scanner class)

Basic arithmetic operations

Modular programming


This task helped me strengthen my understanding of Java fundamentals and improve my ability to write clean, modular code.
Task-3:Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed Task 3: ATM Interface as part of my Java Development Internship at CODSOFT! ðŸš€

In this project, I built a simple ATM simulation system using Core Java concepts such as:
âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
âœ… Classes and Objects
âœ… Methods and User Input Validation
âœ… Real-time interaction for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:

User-friendly menu for ATM operations

Secure withdrawal and deposit handling

Real-time balance updates

Input validation for sufficient balance


This task helped me strengthen my understanding of Java fundamentals, modular programming, and user interaction logic.
